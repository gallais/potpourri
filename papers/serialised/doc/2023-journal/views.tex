\section{Interlude: Views and Singletons}\label{sec:view}

The precise indexing of pointers by a runtime-irrelevant copy of the value
they are pointing to means that inspecting the buffer's content should
not only return runtime information but also refine the index to reflect
that information at the type-level.
%
As a consequence, the functions we are going to define in the following
subsections are views.

\subsection{Views}

A view
in the sense of Wadler~\citep{DBLP:conf/popl/Wadler87},
and subsequently refined by McBride and McKinna~\citep{DBLP:journals/jfp/McBrideM04}
for a type $T$ is a type family $V$ indexed by $T$ together
with a function which maps values $t$ of type $T$ to values of type
$V\,t$.
%
By inspecting the $V\,t$ values we can learn something about the
$t$ input.
%
The prototypical example is perhaps the `snoc` (`cons' backwards) view
of right-nested lists as if they were left-nested.
We present the \IdrisType{Snoc} family below.

\ExecuteMetaData[Snoc.idr.tex]{Snoc}

By matching on a value of type
(\IdrisType{Snoc} \IdrisBound{xs}) we get to learn
either that \IdrisBound{xs} is empty (\IdrisData{Lin}, nil backwards)
or that it has an initial segment \IdrisBound{init} and a last element
\IdrisBound{last} (\IdrisBound{init} \IdrisData{:<} \IdrisBound{last}).
%
The function \IdrisFunction{unsnoc} demonstrates that we can always
\emph{view} a \IdrisType{List} in a \IdrisType{Snoc}-manner.

\ExecuteMetaData[Snoc.idr.tex]{unsnoc}

Here we defined \IdrisType{Snoc} as an inductive family but it can
sometimes be convenient to define the family recursively instead.
In which case the \IdrisType{Singleton} inductive family can
help us connect runtime values to their
runtime-irrelevant type-level counterparts.

\input{singleton}

We are now equipped with the appropriate notions and definitions to
look at a buffer's content.
