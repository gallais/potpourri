\section{Benchmarks}\label{sec:timing}

Now that we have the ability to read, write, and program directly
over trees stored in a buffer we can run some experiments to see
whether this allows us to gain anything over the purely functional
programming style.

For all of these tests we generate a full tree of a given depth and
compare the time it takes to run the composition of deserialising
the tree and applying the pure function to the time it takes to run
its pointer-based counterpart.
%
Each test is run 20 times in a row, and the duration averaged.
%
We manually run chezscheme's garbage collector before the start of
each time measurement.

All of our plots use a logarithmic y axis because the runtime of the
deserialisation-based function is necessarily exponential in the depth
of the full tree.

The \IdrisFunction{sum} function explores the entirety of the tree
and as such the difference between the deserialisation-based and the
pointer-based functions is minimal.
%\todo{Measure memory footprint?}
%
The \IdrisFunction{rightmost} function only explores the rightmost
branch of the tree and we correspondingly see an exponential speedup
for the pointer-based function which is able to efficiently skip past
every left subtree.

\end{center}

The deep \IdrisFunction{copy} is unsurprisingly also exponential in
the depth of the tree being copied whereas the version based on the
\IdrisFunction{copyData} primitive for buffers is vastly faster.
