\subsubsection{Data-Generic Programming}

There is a long tradition of data-generic
programming~\cite{DBLP:conf/ssdgp/Gibbons06} and we will mostly focus here
on the approach based on the careful reification of a precise universe of
discourse as an inductive family in a host type theory,
and the definition of generic programs by induction over this family.

One early such instance is Pfeifer and Rue{\ss}'
`polytypic proof construction'~\cite{DBLP:conf/tphol/PfeiferR99}
meant to replace unsafe meta-programs deriving recursors
(be they built-in support, or user-written tactics).

\todo{See refs. in n-ary polymorphic functions}

In his PhD thesis, Morris~\cite{DBLP:phd/ethos/Morris07} declares various
universes for strictly positive types and families and defines by generic
programming
further types (the type of one-hole contexts),
modalities (the universal and existential predicate lifting over the functors he considers),
and functions (map, boolean equality).

\subsubsection{Efficient Runtime Representation of Inductive Values}

Although not dealing explicitly with programming over serialised data,
Monnier's work~\cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/Monnier19} with its focus on performance and
in particular on the layout of inductive values at runtime,
partially motivated our endeavour.
%
Provided that we find a way to get the specialisation and partial evaluation
of the generically defined views, we ought to be able to achieve --purely in
user code-- Monnier's vision of n-ary tuples with constant time access to each
component.

\subsubsection{Working on Serialised Data}

LoCal~\cite{DBLP:conf/pldi/VollmerKRS0N19} is the work that originally
motivated the design of this library.
%
We have demonstrated that generic programming within a dependently typed
language can yield the sort of benefits other language can only achieve
by inventing entirely new intermediate languages and compilation schemes.

LoCal was improved upon with a re-thinking of the serialisation scheme
making the approach compatible with parallel
programming~\cite{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/KoparkarRVKN21}.
This impressive improvement is a natural candidate for future work on our
part: the authors demonstrate it is possible to reap the benefits of
both programming over serialised data
and dividing up the work over multiple processors
with almost no additional cost in a purely sequential scenario \todo{double check}.
