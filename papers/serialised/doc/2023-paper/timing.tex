\section{Benchmarks}

For all of these tests we generate a full tree of a given depth and compare
the time it takes to run the composition of deserialising the tree and applying the pure function
to the time it takes to run its pointer-based counterpart.
%
We manually run chezscheme's garbage collector before each time measurement.
%
All of our plots use a logarithmic y axis because the runtime of the
deserialisation-based function is necessarily exponential in the depth
of the full tree.



The \IdrisFunction{sum} function explores the entirety of the tree and as such the difference
between the deserialisation-based and the pointer-based functions is minimal.
\todo{Measure memory footprint?}

\graphOf{sum}


The \IdrisFunction{rightmost} function only explores the rightmost branch of
the tree and we correspondingly see an exponential speedup for the pointer-based
function which is able to efficiently skip past every left subtree.
