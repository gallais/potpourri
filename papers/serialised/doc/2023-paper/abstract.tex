\begin{abstract}
In typed functional languages, one can typically only manipulate data
in a type-safe manner if it first has been deserialised into an in-memory
tree represented as a graph of nodes-as-structs and subterms-as-pointers.

We demonstrate how we can use QTT as implemented in \idris{} to define
a small universe of serialised datatypes, and provide generic programs
allowing users to process values stored contiguously in buffers.

Our approach allows implementors to prove the full functional
correctness by construction of the IO functions processing the
data stored in the buffer.
