\section{Conclusion}

We have seen how, using a universe of descriptions indexed by their static
and dynamic sizes, we can define a precise language of values serialised in
a buffer.
%
This allowed us to develop a library to manipulate such trees in a seamless,
correct, and generic manner either using low-level combinators like
\IdrisFunction{poke} or high-level programs like a data-polymorphic
\IdrisFunction{fold}.
%
We then provided users with convenient tools to write serialisation processes
thus allowing them to compositionally build correct-by-construction values
stored in buffers.
