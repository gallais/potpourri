  Thanks to XXX for comments.

  We would like to thank Bob Atkey for his suggestion to index
  stages by a phase, thus allowing us to ensure that a staged
  term does not have any static subterm.

  We would additionally like to thank the reviewers for their
  helpful suggestions of relevant related works.
