History
-------

This is mostly what used to go on my patch-tag repositories because all
of these half-baked, half-thought ideas needed not be exposed. Now that
patch-tag is shutting down, I have decided to move the salvageable things
over here.

I would like to use this opportunity to express a lot of gratitude towards
Thomas Hartman who built up and maintained patch-tag for quite a few years
thus providing us with a free and easy to use hosting solution.
