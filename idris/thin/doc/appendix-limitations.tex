\section{Current Limitations of \idris{}}\label{appendix:limitations}

This challenge, suggested by Jacques Carette, highlights some of the current
limitations of \idris{}.
%
The goal is to use the \IdrisType{Vect} type defined in~\cref{sec:vectaslist}
and define a view that un-does vector-append.
%
Vector append can easily be defined by induction over the first vector.

\ExecuteMetaData[VectAsList.idr.tex]{append}

If the first vector is empty we can readily return the second vector.
%
If it is cons-headed, we can return the head and compute the tail by performing
a recursive call.

\ExecuteMetaData[VectAsList.idr.tex]{splitAtrel}

\ExecuteMetaData[VectAsList.idr.tex]{splitAtcons}

\todo{explain match on Refl}

\ExecuteMetaData[VectAsList.idr.tex]{splitAt}

More damning is the unwritten story: this somewhat unsatisfactory solution is
the one we arrived at during interactive development.
%
Other attemps ended with error messages that would have puzzled more junior users
of the system.
%
Some of these errors revealed underlying bugs in \idris{} while others qualify
more as open research questions on the development of practical programming
languages based on quantitative type theory.
\todo{remind people idris is a research project?}
