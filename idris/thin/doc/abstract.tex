  State of the art optimisation passes for dependently typed languages can help
  erase the redundant information typical of invariant-rich data structures and
  programs.
  These automated processes do not dramatically change the \emph{structure} of
  the data, even though more efficient representations could be available.

  Using Quantitative Type Theory, we demonstrate how to define an invariant-rich,
  typechecking time data structure that is \emph{guaranteed} to compile to an
  efficient runtime memory representation.

  Unlike other approaches, the complexity of the resulting representation is
  entirely predictable, we do not require both representations to have the
  same structure, and yet we are able to seamlessly program as if we were
  using the high-level structure.
