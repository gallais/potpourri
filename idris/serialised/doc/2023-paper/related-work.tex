LoCal~\cite{DBLP:conf/pldi/VollmerKRS0N19} is the work that originally
motivated the design of this library.

We have demonstrated that generic programming within a dependently typed
language can yield the sort of benefits other language can only achieve
by inventing entirely new intermediate languages and compilation schemes.

LoCal was improved upon with a re-thinking of the serialisation scheme
making the approach compatible with parallel
programming~\cite{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/KoparkarRVKN21}.
This impressive improvement is a natural candidate for future work on our
part: the authors demonstrate it is possible to reap the benefits of
both programming over serialised data
and dividing up the work over multiple processors
with almost no additional cost in a purely sequential scenario \todo{double check}.
