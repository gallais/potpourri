\section{Limitations and Future Work}

Partial evaluation and program specialisation to remove the interpretation
overhead incurred by working generically.
\todo{Look into 2LTT}

We currently do not support in-place updates to the data stored in a buffer.
This could however be beneficial for functions like \IdrisFunction{map}.
We ought to be able to leverage \idris{}'s linear quantity to provide users
with serialised value that can be safely updated in place.


A natural next candidate is a universe of indexed data: we can currently
model lists or trees but we cannot model vectors, or correct-by-construction
red-black trees.\todo{correct RB trees: cite (Weirich?)}
