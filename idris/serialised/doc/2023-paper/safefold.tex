\section*{\assertTotal{}-free \IdrisFunction{fold}}\label{sec:safefold}

We include below the alternative definition of \IdrisFunction{fold} which
is seen as total by \idris{}. It is mutually defined with what is essentially
the supercompilation of
(\IdrisKeyword{\textbackslash} \IdrisBound{d} \IdrisKeyword{=>} \IdrisFunction{fmap} \IdrisBound{d} (\IdrisFunction{fold} \IdrisBound{alg})).
