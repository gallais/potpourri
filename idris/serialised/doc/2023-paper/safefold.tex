\section{Defining \IdrisFunction{fold} without using \assertTotal{}}\label{sec:safefold}

We include below the alternative definitions of \IdrisFunction{fold}
(respectively processing inductive data and data stored in a buffer)
which are seen as total by \idris{}.
%
Each of them is mutually defined with what is essentially
the supercompilation of
(\IdrisKeyword{\textbackslash} \IdrisBound{d} \IdrisKeyword{=>} \IdrisFunction{fmap} \IdrisBound{d} (\IdrisFunction{fold} \IdrisBound{alg})).
