\section{Descriptions}\label{sec:desc}

Descriptions are essentially arbitrarily nested tuples of
values of type unit,
bytes,
and recursive substructures.

Our type of description has three indices corresponding to three important
invariants being tracked.
%
First, the statically known size of the described data.
%
Second, the number of offsets that need to be stored to compensate for the
fact that some subterms do not have a statically known size.
%
Third, whether the current description is being used in the rightmost branch
of the overall layer description.

A datatype description is given by a list of constructor descriptions.
