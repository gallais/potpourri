\section{Serialising Data}\label{sec:serialising}

So far all of our example programs involved taking an inductive value
apart and computing a numeric value.
%
But we may instead want to compute another value in serialised form.
%
In this section we are going to spell out how we can define high-level
constructs allowing users to do just that in a correct-by-construction
manner.



\ExecuteMetaData[SaferIndexed.idr.tex]{serialisedmap}

%% \subsection{Generic Traverse}
%% \ExecuteMetaData[SaferIndexed.idr.tex]{traverse}


\subsection{Executing a Serialisation Action}

Now that we can \emph{describe} actions serialising a value to
a buffer, we only need a function allowing to actually perform
these actions.
%
This is provided by the \IdrisFunction{execSerialising} function
declared below.

\ExecuteMetaData[SaferIndexed.idr.tex]{execSerialising}
