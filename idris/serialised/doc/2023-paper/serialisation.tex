\section{Serialising Data}\label{sec:serialising}

So far all of our example programs involved taking an inductive value
apart and computing a numeric value.
%
But we may instead want to compute another value in serialised form.
%
In this section we are going to spell out how we can define high-level
constructs allowing users to do just that in a correct-by-construction
manner.
