\subsubsection*{Introduction}

Session types are a kind of channel typing discipline ensuring that the
communication patterns of concurrent programs abide by a shared protocol.
%
From t

Limiting ourselves to two communicating parties, we demonstrate how to give a
type-safe implementation of bidirectional channels typed using protocols closed
under sends, receives, branching, and smallest and largest fixpoints.

\subsubsection*{Implementation}

Our implementation is based on a type safe realisation of
Kiselyov and Sabry's open union type~\cite{DBLP:conf/haskell/KiselyovSS13}
using the encoding of scope-safe
De Bruijn indices~\cite{MANUAL:journals/math/debruijn72}
introduced by Brady in the implementation of
Idris 2~\cite{DBLP:conf/ecoop/Brady21}.

Our offset correctness gadget can be seen as a cut down version of
McBride's one hole contexts~\cite{DBLP:conf/popl/McBride08}. Instead
of recording the full path followed by our programs in the finite
state machine describing the protocol, we do not bother recording
loops.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{Limitations and Future Work}

\paragraph{Encoding Uniqueness via Linear Types}
Unlike Brady's prior work in Idris 1~\cite{DBLP:journals/aghcs/Brady17},
we are using Idris 2 which does not currently have uniqueness types.
We are forced to use the linearity granted to us by
Quantitative Type Theory (QTT)~\cite{DBLP:conf/birthday/McBride16,DBLP:conf/lics/Atkey18}
to emulate uniquess which adds a degree of noise to the implementation.
We would ideally want a system combining both to benefit from enhanced
expressivity and efficiency as described by Marshall, Vollmer,
and Orchard~\cite{DBLP:conf/esop/MarshallVO22}.

\paragraph{Small Runtime Overhead}
In the most expressive version of our library, we compute a handful
of key offset values by induction over the protocol. Correspondingly
the protocol is not marked as erased anymore and, if compilation does
not specialise the relevant combinators agressively, then we may very
well be evaluating these relatively small computations at runtime.
%
As far as we understand, directly adding typed staging to Idris 2
through the use of a two-level type theory à la
Kov{\'{a}}cs~\cite{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/Kovacs22} would not be
enough to solve our issue: the protocol does need to persist
through staging, but merely move from QTT's unrestricted to its
erased modality.

\paragraph{Ergonomics}
We found writing the types of inner loops of programs with non-trivial
communication patterns to be tedious as they expose quite a lot of the
powerful but noisy encoding of syntaxes with binding we use.
